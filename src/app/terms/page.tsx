            providers (“Service Providers”). QlutchGrid acts only as a

            2.2. Independent Contractors: Service Providers are independent

            endorse the accuracy of this verification, or the quality, safety,
            credentials, or legality of any Service Provider or their services.

            approval from the respective Service Provider.
